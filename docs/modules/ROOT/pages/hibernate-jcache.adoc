:description: pass:q[In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Hazelcast as a Hibernate second-level cache by leveraging Hibernate's JCache (JSR 107) support. You will also learn how to integrate Hazelcast with Hibernate without using the `hazelcast-hibernate` integration.]

== What Youâ€™ll Learn

{description}

== Prerequisites

- JDK 8+
- Apache Maven 3.2+

== Required Dependencies

First, you need to add the required dependencies.

Include the `hibernate-jcache` and `hibernate-core` dependencies. Keep in mind that both should have the same version:

.pom.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::ROOT:example$hibernate-jcache/pom.xml[tag=doc-hibernate-deps]
----

Make sure to include the `hazelcast` dependency as well:

.pom.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::ROOT:example$hibernate-jcache/pom.xml[tag=doc-hazelcast-dep]
----

== Configure Hibernate JCache RegionFactory

Now, tell Hibernate to use JCache's region factory.

For Hibernate 5.2.x, you need to add a full class name:

[source, xml]
----
<property name="hibernate.cache.region.factory_class">
   org.hibernate.cache.jcache.JCacheRegionFactory
</property>
----


For Hibernate 5.3.x+, it's enough to mention _jcache_:

.hibernate.cfg.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::ROOT:example$hibernate-jcache/src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml[tag=doc-hibernate-factory]
----

== Configure the Cache Provider

You can choose to either use an embedded Hazelcast instance, or connect to an external server using a Hazelcast client.

****
`EMBEDDED`: For creating an embedded Hazelcast instance with an application. This instance cannot be scaled up or
down unless you run or shutdown another Hibernate application with the same server config.

`CLIENT`: For connecting to an existing Hazelcast cluster that can scale up or down independently from your app.

- You can learn more about the differences between client and embedded topologies https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/#hazelcast-topology[here.]
****

Now, configure the provider.

To use native client:

[source, xml]
----
<property name="hibernate.javax.cache.provider">
   com.hazelcast.client.cache.impl.HazelcastClientCachingProvider
</property>
<property name="hibernate.javax.cache.uri">
   hazelcast-client.xml
</property>
----

To use embedded Hazelcast:

[source, xml]
----
<property name="hibernate.javax.cache.provider">
   com.hazelcast.cache.impl.HazelcastServerCachingProvider
</property>
<property name="hibernate.javax.cache.uri">
   hazelcast.xml
</property>
----


== Configure the Cache

Configure the cache via `hazelcast.xml` and the `<cache>` part:

[source, xml]
----
<cache name="custom.cache.region.name">
    <statistics-enabled>true</statistics-enabled>
    <management-enabled>true</management-enabled>
    <eviction size="10000" max-size-policy="ENTRY_COUNT" eviction-policy="LRU" />
</cache>
----

NOTE: To track the cache statistics on Hazelcast Management Center, you have to enable the statistics
(disabled by default) for the cache configuration of the Hazelcast instance.

NOTE: If client mode is used, cache configurations must be set on the server configuration (`hazelcast.xml`), not on the client-side (`hazelcast-client.xml`).

TIP: If you do not define a specific region name, the default cache configuration is going to be
used. Hence it will not be visible on Hazelcast Management Center. To apply
a config to all regions, you can use a wildcard for `name` property (e.g., `name="*"`).

For other cache configuration properties, see cache configuration section on the documentation
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#icache-configuration[here].
Eviction size and policy properties might be useful for this case.

== Run the Application

The samples consist of three classes demonstrating various types of Hibernate caches:

- `com.hazelcast.hibernate.jcache.CollectionCache`
- `com.hazelcast.hibernate.jcache.EntityCache`
- `com.hazelcast.hibernate.jcache.QueryCache`

All of them are running using an in-memory H2 instance and can be run using their `main()` methods.

== Summary

You've configured an application to use a Hibernate second-level cache with Hazelcast.
